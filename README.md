# Gavin Medley's ECEN 5813 (PES - Principles of Embedded Software) Assignments

If you are an ECEN 5813 student, don't copy this work. Lalit will catch you.

If you're looking at this, you're probably assessing my embedded C experience for a job. 
Compiling and running this code is probably a non-starter but reading through this should give you 
insight into my ability to factor my code well.

The final project is by far the most complex project in this repository. Each assignment has its own readme.

Thanks for looking!
